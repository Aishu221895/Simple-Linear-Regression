# Simple-Linear-Regression
STUDY LONGER SCORE HIGHER

In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
We see that there's a linear relation between the hours of study and scores.

Equation of linear regression:

𝑦=𝑐+𝑚1𝑥1+𝑚2𝑥2+...+𝑚𝑛𝑥𝑛

𝑦 is the response 𝑐 is the intercept 𝑚1 is the coefficient for the first feature 𝑚𝑛 is the coefficient for the nth feature

In our case:

y= X*hours+c

Scores(y) = 9.788566686749046*Hours + 2.370815382341881

No of Hours = 9.25
Predicted Score = 92.91505723477056
So a student studying for 9.25 hours can score 93%!
